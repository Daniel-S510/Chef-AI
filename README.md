# Chef AI

Say goodbye to your days of endlessly searching for recipes!

This simple HTML app uses Google's Gemini AI to generate custom recipes (The quality of which are not guarenteed)

The .apk version is just the HTML version ported to an Android app with no change

(If it downloads as a text doccument then just change the file extension from .txt to .html)

You will need your own Gemini API key for it to actually generate anything

You can get an API key here: https://aistudio.google.com/u/1/apikey
